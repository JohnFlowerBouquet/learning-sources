Simple page for viewing free knowledge sources from around the web that I used during my journey to become front-end developer!

### Future plans
For now I update app manually:
-opening the page on my local machine
-add entries
-download the updated .json file
-push updated list to github

In the future I plan to set an api server (e.g. on Heroku) to use that for storing remotely .json file and update it automatically.
